      <h2>What the Future Brings</h2>
      
      <p>As the upgrade of previous generations of HTTP shows, the future won't bring a new model.
         HTTP builds on itself, using its underlying semantics in all versions. It is likely that
         HTTP/3 will continue to be used by more servers and browsers and will grow to become the
         default version of HTTP. As of now, an HTTP/4 is unlikely, as the plan is to keep the same
         request/response semantics and keep improving the layers underneath and around them.
         The QUIC technology has already gotten an update and was rolled out as QUIC v2 (RFC 9369).
         As time passes, HTTP will probably not experience any large changes. Instead, it will receive
         updates as necessary to keep its current technologies up to date. Privacy and security actively
         get better, as better encryption mechanisms are employed. The future of HTTP is relatively steady,
         with support for it to come for a long time.</p>
