      <h2>History of HTML</h2>
      <p>The development of HTTP began in 1989, with CERN scientist Tim Berners-Lee's proposal for the Web.
         This was a document describing the behavior of a client-server interaction using HTTP version 0.9.
         It was proposed in order to gain the ability to exchange documents among different lab environments.
         This version included a one line GET command that would return only HTML with no headers or status codes.
         This proposal was accepted and underwent further development and was eventually released to the public
         as HTTP version 1.0 in 1996. This version was formally documented as RFC 1945 by the Internet Engineering
         Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  This updated version included request and
         response headers, status codes to describe outcomes of pending requests, additional media aside from
         HTML documents, as well as additional methods for interacting with the server. This was a big jump in
         progress for HTTP, and it placed the initial foundation for the HTTP technology we use today. As
         version 1.0 was underway, proper standardization of the technology was also being created. In 1997,
         just a few months after HTTP 1.0 was released, HTTP 1.1 was published and documented as RFC 2068.
         This was the first standardized instance of this protocol, and offered many improvements over 1.0.
         With version 1.1 came reusable TCP connections, the HOST header, chunked transfer abilities,
         additional caching, and content negotiation (language, type, encoding). These improvements
         brought HTTP from a simple file fetcher to an advanced internet protocol. Reusing connections
         and validating caches cut latency and bandwidth as pages grew more complex. However, since
         it still uses a single TCP stream, users can only download one thing at a time. This is
         called head-of-line blocking, and due to the expensive nature of TCP connections, it set
         the stage for Google’s SPDY, HTML/2, and HTML 3.</p>

      <p>As the early 2000s passed, web browsers became increasingly complex, causing a strain that even the
         updated HTTP/1.1 protocol couldn’t effectively handle. A team at Google decided to address this problem
         and came up with SPDY (“speedy”), published in 2009. SPDY kept the semantics (the methods, headers, and status codes)
         of HTTP, but added an additional binary framing layer. This layer allows for request and response multiplexing,
         which is when requests and responses can be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection. It also compressed
         headers, prioritized important resources, and offered interleaved streaming, which assigned stream ID’s to
         fragments of data, so the receiver can reassemble the stream in correct order. After being published, well
         known browsers and websites such as Chrome, Google, Facebook and Twitter adopted SPDY and proved it worked
         faster than HTTP/1.1. The results were impressive enough that it convinced the IETF to base HTTP/2 off SPDY’s
         design, leading to RFC 7540 in 2015, and the retirement of SPDY in 2016. Due to the additional binary layer,
         HTTP/2 was not backwards compatible, and therefore did not take the name HTTP/1.2.</p>

      <p> With the standardization of HTTP/2, most of the SPDY technology was reused, but a couple things were updated
         in the process. The biggest change this standardization brought was the universal usage of HTTP/2 across browsers
         and servers worldwide, but additional subtle changes were also made before release. It replaced SPDY’s DEFLATE
         header compression with HPACK, a more secure and efficient header compression format. Another important change
         was the switch from SPDY’s NPN protocol negotiation to ALPN which allowed clients and servers to agree on which
         protocol to use during the TLS handshake. This brought consistency, a quicker setup, and additional security
         among web browsers. Although HTTP/2 showed a drastic improvement over HTTP/1.1, the occurrence of head-of-line
         blocking on TCP connections, and the additional latency of their 3-way handshake was still a large inconvenience.
         In the early 2010s Google began experimenting with a new protocol they developed called gQUIC, which ran HTTP
         on an encrypted UDP transport connection. This new protocol quickly gained traction and was officially
         standardized as QUIC (RFC 9000-9002) by the IETF. QUIC gives each request its own stream, eliminating
         the main problem of TCP head-of-line blocking. The IETF integrated the semantics of HTTP onto QUIC,
         forming HTTP/3 (RFC 9114). As of today, this is the newest version of HTTP being publicly used. HTTP/1.1
         and HTTP/2 are both still widely used, but HTTP/3 is the default if both browsers support it.</p>

         <p>As the upgrade of previous generations of HTTP shows, the future won't bring a new model.
         HTTP builds on itself, using its underlying semantics in all versions. It is likely that
         HTTP/3 will continue to be used by more servers and browsers and will grow to become the
         default version of HTTP. As of now, an HTTP/4 is unlikely, as the plan is to keep the same
         request/response semantics and keep improving the layers underneath and around them.
         The QUIC technology has already gotten an update and was rolled out as QUIC v2 (RFC 9369).
         As time passes, HTTP will probably not experience any large changes. Instead, it will receive
         updates as necessary to keep its current technologies up to date. Privacy and security actively
         get better, as better encryption mechanisms are employed. The future of HTTP is relatively steady,
         with support for it to come for a long time.</p>
