      <h2>Semantics</h2>
      <p>HTTP has evolved over the years, and while quite simple, it has
         many parts that make up its protocol. Each request includes the
         method, target, headers, and sometimes a body. The method starts
         the request and declares the semantics of it (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD).
         The target defines what or where the request is going and usually
         includes a URL. These look different depending on HTTP version,
         as HTTP/1.1 requires the Host header, or the server will deny
         the request. Headers are metadata that define the request’s
         characteristics including content negotiation, routing, authorization/
         cookies, and caching. In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, only the start-line pieces
         (method, scheme, authority, path) are carried as pseudo-headers;
         regular headers stay regular headers. The body is optional, and 
         it is the payload of the request declared by the content type.
         For example, it could carry a payload like files or video segments.
         The responses work a little differently, they mirror the request,
         and each includes a status code, headers, and an optional body as well.
         The status code informs the client of what happened with their request,
         whether it succeeded, failed, needs authorization, or was redirected.
         The response headers work like the requests’, but they describe what
         the server sent, where request headers describe what client wants.
         The body of the response is the content that is sent back to the client,
         if it doesn’t have a body, then there was probably an error or the server
         had nothing to return. When all of these components are combined, the server
         knows exactly how to handle a request, and the client will be presented with
         the correct data, or a reason as to why it wasn't obtained.</p>

         <h2>Caching</h2>
      <p>Another important part of HTTP is its built-in caching that allows browsers
         to reuse work, rather than having to fetch everything all over again.
         Caching is controlled by the Cache-Control response header. This header
         uses directives to define its cache, such as Max Age is how long a cached
         copy may be reused, and Public or Private says who is allowed to keep it
         or have access to it. If a stored cache goes passed the “Max Age” directive,
         it becomes stale. When a copy is stale, the cache has to either ask the
         server if it changed or fetch a new one. Two additional directives are
         No-cache and No-store. If you use No-cache, the cache must check with
         the server to see if there’s a copy every time before reuse. If you
         use No-store, it never saves a copy at all, so nothing will become
         stale. Caching also works across all versions of HTTP, employing
         the same cache headers and validators, making it a key piece of HTTP technology.</p>
