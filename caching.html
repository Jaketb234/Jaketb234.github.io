      <h2>Caching</h2>
      <p>Another important part of HTTP is its built-in caching that allows browsers
         to reuse work, rather than having to fetch everything all over again.
         Caching is controlled by the Cache-Control response header. This header
         uses directives to define its cache, such as Max Age is how long a cached
         copy may be reused, and Public or Private says who is allowed to keep it
         or have access to it. If a stored cache goes passed the “Max Age” directive,
         it becomes stale. When a copy is stale, the cache has to either ask the
         server if it changed or fetch a new one. Two additional directives are
         No-cache and No-store. If you use No-cache, the cache must check with
         the server to see if there’s a copy every time before reuse. If you
         use No-store, it never saves a copy at all, so nothing will become
         stale. Caching also works across all versions of HTTP, employing
         the same cache headers and validators, making it a key piece of HTTP technology.</p>
